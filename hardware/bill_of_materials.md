# Bill of Materials (BOM)

## Main Components
- 1x STM32F103C8T6 (Bluepill board)
- 1x DRL with addressable LEDs (e.g., WS2812 strip)
- 1x DRL with non-addressable LEDs
- 1x 5V voltage regulator (if needed for LEDs)
- 1x ST-Link V2 programmer (for flashing)
- Assorted resistors (for current limiting, e.g., 330Î© for data line)
- Assorted capacitors (e.g., 1000uF for LED power smoothing)
- N-channel MOSFETs or suitable transistors (for switching non-addressable LEDs)
- Wires, connectors, PCB or protoboard

## Optional
- 1x 3.3V voltage regulator (if needed)
- Fuses for protection
- Enclosure

Adjust quantities and values as needed for your specific DRL setup.
